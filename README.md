# Predicting-Billboard-Top-100-with-Lyrics
Project done for Intro to Data Science at MSOE using data found at https://www.kaggle.com/rakannimer/billboard-lyrics

This is my first real data science/machine learning project, I used Jupyter notebooks

Uses point-wise and pair-wise ranking algorithms to attempt to predict if a song will be higher or lower in the Billboard top 100 based on it's lyrics
